    "The moderation teams of Reddit are overwhelmed with the vast number of posts and comments spanning its various subreddit communities. The teams in particular have trouble ensuring all posts of a given subreddit meet relevancy standards. The aim of this project is to build a model that can take text content from two different subreddits and accurately classify the origin of each piece of content. The main metrics to maximize are both the accuracy and F1 scores of the models. If successful, this model can be further improved upon to be used to classify content from any number of different subreddits across the website. This will greatly alleviate the burden of the Reddit moderation staff and open new avenues of effective moderation. The two subreddits used in this study are **r/news** and **r/conspiracy**. The four classification models constructed to solve this problem are Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, XGBClassifier, and Voting Classifier. "

    "Reddit is a social news aggregation and discussion website. Registered users submit content to the site which can be voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user created boards called subreddits. Reddit administrators and subreddit moderators moderate the communities.<sup>1</sup> According to March 2023 statistics, Reddit ranks as the ninth most visited website globally and the sixth most visited website in the United States.<sup>2</sup>\n",

It iteratively trains an array of decision trees. The final prediction is a weighted sum of all of the tree predictions.<sup>6</sup> A Voting Classifier is a machine learning model that trains on an ensemble of numerous models. It aggregates the results of each classifier and predicts the output class based on the highest majority of voting.<sup>7</sup>\n",
